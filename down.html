            On our journey, I've learned something important from each person I met, and I've built a good network <br>for my future. I've seen people do things differently, 
            and it taught me to fix my mistakes and improve<br> my skills with the help of my network.The exchange of information during travel has added a unique <br>layer to my experiences, 
            offering a fresh perspective and fostering personal growth.<br><br>
            So grateful for this amazing trip! Big thanks to Almighty for making it happen. Couldn't have done it without our mentor's guidance,SIH Jury panel members,our team coordinator 
            and thanks to all my friends for<br>sharing the ride â€“ we learned and laughed together every step of the way. What a journey!</justify>
